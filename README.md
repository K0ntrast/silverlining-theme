# A Traditional makeover set for modern Linux desktops.

![](https://github.com/K0ntrast/silverlining-theme/raw/main/silverlining_title.png)

## Coming real soon!

### Background:

I created an icon and theme set of my own as I wasn't totally satisfied with many of the themes available for Linux desktop environemnts. I'm not that big of a fan of all these modernised, dark-mode centric, "flat" and over-simplified icon sets and window frames. I wanted something fresh, a bit more nostalgic, reminicent of the late 90s and early 2000s desktop environments.

These detailed, skeuomorphic icons do go against the grain of the more modern "dark mode" & "flat" icon themes to offer a traditional desktop experince with a modern flare. Inspired by Apple's Platinum (incl. Rhapsody), Red Hat's Bluecurve, KDE's 2.2-3.0 Classic, GNOME 2.x, Raspberry Pi's PiXEL and OPENSTEP/NeXTSTEP. I've compiled a colleciton of icons to bring back that familiar feeling.

### Compatibility:
These have been tested in GTK-based desktops only. Namely MATE 1.20+, XFCE 4.12+, LXDE v0.10+ and Openbox 3.6.1+ only.

Bear in mind this is a **BETA** release and still in **TESTING** phase. A final release is long way away yet.

Icon resources have been compiled by the author from various free sources (with further modification) around the WWW. Each has been modified with GIMP.

### Icon Set:
This icon pack is a complete drop in replacement. Silverlining is intended to be a full comprehensive pack, not a supplimentary pack like so many others. The goal is to be totally independent and not rely on a fallback theme to fill any missing icons.

These icons are distributed freely under the GNU GPL software license. Feel free to contribute to, redistribute and fork this project.

*Programs generally use their own internal icons as created by their own respective authours.*

#### Author's Note:
If you think that this theme looks "old" or "dated", that’s because it is, and that’s very much its purpose.

Yes, it's a currently a bit messy, rough around the edges and has lots of polishing work to be done, but what is here serves as a project starting point.

+ I'd like to dedicate this project to my former college lecturer, Dennis Peek at the South West Regional College in Western Australia. A good man who was instrumental in helping me take the plunge into the wonderful world of Linux (c. 2005). Ironically, he wasn't a fan of GUIs but rather pure command line.

Silverlining currently has application specific themes for XFE, SMPlayer, Claws Mail and aMule. More to come later.

## TO-DO:
* Write a "design language" document. Complete with 5-6 shades per colour for a set palette.
* Fill in any missing icons
* Style icons and themes with more consistancy.
* Redraw the icons without upscaling. A full, original SVG format set would be an *awesome* start!
* Compatibility with more desktop environments (NSCDE, i3, KDE, LXQt, Cinammon, etc.)
* More program specific skins/themes for system-wide consistency (i.e. double commander, xfe, midnight commander, filezilla, firefox, chromium, thunderbird, gvim, conky, atom, geany, SciTE, and more...)
* Optimise the PNG icons for faster loading on low resource and SBC machines
* Reduce size of deployment package by reducing unessecary icon double ups
* Add more symbolic links to cater for various DEs icon references.
* Create deployment packages for easy rollout on distros (deb, rpm, xbps, pkg, etc.)
* Complete MIME types list for all filetype icons
* Automated script for installing and setting system fonts (via dconf?)
