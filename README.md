# A Traditional makeover set for modern Linux desktops.

![](https://github.com/K0ntrast/silverlining-theme/raw/main/silverlining_title.png)

## Coming real soon!
I created an icon and theme set of my own as I wasn't totally satisfied with many of the themes available for Linux desktop environemnts. I'm not that big of a fan of all these modernised, overly "flat" and over-simplified icon sets. I wanted something a bit more nostalgic, reminicent of the late 90s and early 2000s desktop environments. These detailed, skeuomorphic icons do go against the grain of the more modern "dark mode" & "flat" icon themes to offer a traditional desktop experince with a modern flare. Inspired by Apple's Platinum (incl. Rhapsody), Red Hat's Bluecurve, KDE's 2.2-3.0 Classic, GNOME 2.x, Raspberry Pi's PiXEL and OPENSTEP/NeXTSTEP, I've compiled a colleciton of icons to bring back that familiar feeling.
These have been tested in GTK-based desktops only. Namely MATE 1.20+, XFCE 4.12+ and LXDE v0.10+ only.
Bear in mind this is a BETA release and still in TESTING phase. A final release is long way away yet.
Icon resources have been compiled by the author from various free sources (with further modification) around the WWW. Each has been modified with GIMP
Clean Code, a division of Sprydon Enterprise.
This icon pack is a complete drop in replacement. It is a full comprehensive pack, not a supplimentary pack like so many. The goal is to be totally dependent and not rely on a fallback theme to fill any missing icons.
These icons are distributed freely under the GNU GPL software license. Feel free to contribute to, redistribute and fork this project.
Programs generally use their own internal icons as created by their own authours.
NOTE: If you think that this theme looks "old" or "dated", that’s because it is, and that’s very much on purpose.

Yes, it's a bit messy, rough around the edges and has lots of polishing still to be done, but what is here serves as a projcet starting point.

Various image elements from Vectorstock, pngicons, iconfinder, pngrepo, kindpng, flaticons, thenounproject, ISO symbol library, wikipedia, icons of repsective software programs and filetypes belonging to their respective owners. Used under fair-use and representation of product. Each icon created has been modified to slightly to suit the theme.

Silverlining currently has application specific themes for XFE, Audacious, Claw Mail and aMule. More to come later.

TO DO:
Write a "design language" document. Complete with 5-6 shades per colour for a palette.
Fill in any missing icons
Style icons and themes with more consistancy.
Redraw the icons without upscaling. A full, original SVG format set would be an AWESOME start!
Compatibility with more desktop environments (NSCDE, i3, KDE, LXQt, Cinammon, etc.)
More program specific skins/themes for system-wide consistency (i.e. double commander, xfe, midnight commander, filezilla, firefox, chromium, thunderbird, gvim, conky, atom, geany, SciTE, and more...)
Optimise the icons for faster loading on low resource and SBC machines
Reduce size of deployment package by reducing unessecary icon double ups
Add more symbolic links to cater for various DEs icon references.
Create deployment packages for easy rollout on distros (deb, rpm, xbps, pkg, etc.)
Complete MIME types list for filetype icons
